The installation is divided into separate directories. Each directory contains a `bash` script and an `md` file for manual installation. 

Each `bash` script or `md` file from any directory can be run separately from the general Arch Linux installation.

You can run `checker.sh` at the root of the repository to make sure that any bash script can run without errors.

General requirements for installing packages separately: 
* Os: Arch linux
* Init system: systemd
